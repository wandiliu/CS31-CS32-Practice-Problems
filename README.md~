# UPE-Induction

Created 2 midterm practice problems for students in CS31 and CS32 @ UCLA. As per required for all UPE candidates. 

Hey guys! So to execute the .o files in your shell:
    1.	  `$ cd` into the directory where the file is located
    2.	  `$ ./NameOfFile.o` to execute the code
    3.	  You should see some kind of output (ie. "All tests passed")

Best of luck!
