# UPE-Induction

Created 2 midterm practice problems for students in CS31 and CS32 @ UCLA. As per required for all UPE candidates. 

Hey guys! So to execute the .o files in your shell:
   1.	  ```$ cd DirectoryWhereCodeIs``` to go into the directory where the ```.o``` file is located
   2.	  ```$ ./NameOfFile.o``` to execute the code
   3.	  You should see some kind of output (ie. "All tests passed")

Best of luck!
